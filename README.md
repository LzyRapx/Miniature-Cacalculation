# Pi-Miniature-Calculation
### Main algorithm ：[Chudnovsky algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm)

### Description
- **The Chudnovsky algorithm is a fast method for calculating the digits of π.** 
- **It was published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1989, and was used in the world record calculations of 2.7 trillion digits of π in December 2009, 5 trillion digits in August 2010, 10 trillion digits in October 2011, 12.1 trillion digits in December 2013 and 22.4 trillion digits of π in November 2016.** 
- **The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(N * Log(N)^3)` where N as N digits of Pi.**
